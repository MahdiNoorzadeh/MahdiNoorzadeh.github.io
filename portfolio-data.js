    about: `I’ve always been fascinated by puzzles, and to me, intelligence itself is the most interesting puzzle of all. This curiosity is what led me to pursue a specialized Bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning back in India. I wanted to do more than just use technology, I wanted to understand how to build it. That same drive brought me to Rutgers for my Master's in Computer Science, where I get to dive into even deeper challenges, like robotics and adaptive learning, alongside brilliant PhD students.\n\nBeyond the code, I’m a natural collaborator and organizer, having led events and served as a class representative. I believe the best solutions come from diverse minds working together. Ultimately, I'm a builder at heart, driven by the challenge of creating elegant solutions for complex problems and seeing them make a real-world impact.`,
